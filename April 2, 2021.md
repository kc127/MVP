My App is called Just DUMP 

Just DUMP allows users to mark and leave a review once they use a public restroom.  

Let me show you how a user can do that: 

This is the first iteration of Just DUMP,  and it's primary focus is collecting data from users. 

Once user generated data crosses a certain threshold, In my second itertion of Just DUMP, I plan to display that data on the map so that users can easily find reliable information online to make their decision. 

I also want to be able to allow users to 
- host their bathroom? for free or charge a small fee if they want 
- find bathrooms based on their preferences

#### Overview 
Today is second day of the project. 


#### Feedback from Vik
- Goals: website first 
- not pushing for mobile for now 
- 2000 rps, not a top goal right now, we first need 1000 rps would be ideal 
- mobile friendly 


 UI Demo
 - if I am logged in, 
 - when they do login, save their trips, look at what was booked is fine 
 - should also be able to look at booked trips 
 - saving and booking trip is not top priority - this user functionality is nice to have , not must to have 

Experience 
- flight + hotel + experience (optional) 


payments: 
- proof of concept, 
- flow must start with flight , they can skip hotel, experience 

- all ready to go package 

- the flow, the flight, hotel, experience, 
- color accents 
- no logo, just use next stop 


partnership 
- user authention is nice to have not important 
- sponsored hotels
